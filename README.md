My solutions for puzzles in Kevin Mitnick's book, "Ghost in the wires"

Puzzles consist of simple shifts initially.  These are brute forced using a single key

Later chapters require the answer of previous challenges, as a key to implement a shift.  These are then bruteforced by a set number of shifts to reveal further puzzles.
